Lessons:
- #6: Pulled after 8 outs (75 pitches, 14 BF, 5.4 pitches per batter). Our 69% leaned on 18+ outs in 26 of 29 regular-season starts; playoff hooks are quicker. Fixed by L17 (halve postseason leash history, cap starter-length props at Medium).
- #13: Same script as #6. Process miss: this entry leg was priced at 47% (we had the over at 55%). Every entry leg must be priced and clear break-even before submitting (L20, edge card).
- #22: Lost by the minimum: 2 BB in 18 BF. He had walked 3 in each of his previous 2 starts; we noted it but the model doesn't weight recent walk rate. Watch for a repeat before changing the model.
- #24: Same script as #6, and there was no sportsbook price to check it.
- #29: 3 of his 4 H+R+RBI came off Yamamoto (2-RBI single in the 3rd). Hitter unders against a starter are a bet on that starter (L16).
- #33: Correct pass: his history leaned over (57%). Half his production came off the bullpen.
- #36: Correct pass. Lost by the minimum (walk and run in the 1st, single in the 3rd).
- #41: Rated High with no sportsbook price, on a market where our model runs about 7.6 points toward unders and needs a -0.31 logit fix. 9-hole hitter reached 4 of 4; 3 of his 5 H+R+RBI came off the bullpen, so it wasn't the Yamamoto script. Now capped at Medium without a market (L19).
